        Hi! My name is Abby Rasya Angkasa. Currently I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science 
        at Bina Nusantara University. Recently I interested in Competitive Programming because it is really
        challenging for me. In this semester I chose Competitive Programming for my Elective Course. 
        I really want to know more about algorithms to solve complex problems.

      <p>
        I live alone at my parents 2nd house. The challenge that I have to face is time management and I have to be
        more dicipline to my self. I also joined gym membership and soon I want to join Muaythai. I do exercises because
        that are the way I could relieve my stress. I do a lot of experiment about my self too since I joined University
        that is why I know my self better.
