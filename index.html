        Hi! My name is Abby Rasya Angkasa. I am a 3rd year student of Computer Science 
        at Bina Nusantara University. Recently I interested in Competitive Programming because it is really
        challenging for me. I have to think about how to improve an algorithms and it trains my problem
        solving skills.

        More About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        I get used to time management and responsibility to accomplish a task. Team work trains my
        self-aware and responsibility. Besides of study life, I also joined gym membership and soon 
        I want to join Muaythai. I do exercises because that are the way I could relieve my stress. 
        I do a lot of experiment about my self too since I joined University that is why I know my self better.
